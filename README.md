# CVE-202130858
Hi there! Thanks for testing out my first ever Github repository &amp; attempt of an implementation of an iOS (and technically PS4) webkit exploit! So you are aware: I did not discover this exploit, and I also did not write most of this code. So far, I have started off with modifying existing code to begin to learn how this all works. Let me know how your experience went!

More information on this vulnerability from Google's Project Zero team: https://googleprojectzero.github.io/0days-in-the-wild/0day-RCAs/2021/CVE-2021-30858.html

This test will not modify/harm your device in any way, nor will it access your data or make your phone explode. All this will do is see if you are vulnerable.
